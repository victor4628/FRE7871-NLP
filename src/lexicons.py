"""Loading the word lists.

Everything you need comes from one file, the Loughran-McDonald Master Dictionary:

    Negative      Fin-Neg, 2,355 words. How bad the news is.
    Uncertainty   Fin-Unc,   297 words. How sure management is.
    Positive, Litigious, Strong_Modal, Weak_Modal  -- available, not required.

The rest of this module rebuilds the Harvard General Inquirer negative list. That
is OPTIONAL, for the extra-credit comparison only. The Harvard file ships root
words, so LM expanded 2,005 roots into 4,187 inflected forms by hand; the rules
here approximate that and land nearer 5,000, which is a real deviation you would
have to disclose if you use it.
